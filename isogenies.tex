\section{Enumerating Isogenies}

The goal is to enumerate the isogeny class of simple abelian subvarieties $A$
of $J_0(N)$ for $N$ prime, up to isomorphism. The main objective is to prove

\begin{theorem}\ref{theorem:non_eisen_iso_classify}
    Let $A$ be a simple subvariety of $J_0(N)$ with $N$ prime. Let
    $\O=\ZZ[a_i]$, where $a_i$ are the Hecke coefficients of the newform
    attached to $A$. Let $H$ be a set of representatives of the class group
    (Picard group?) of $\O$.

    Let $\varphi:A\to A'$ be an isogeny whose kernel has support outside the
    Eisenstein primes and primes of residue characteristic 2. Then $A'\isom
    A/A[q]$ for some $q\in H$.
\end{theorem}

I haven't figured it out fully. But I think I can show finite $G$-modules
supported away from 2 are Hecke module. Here's very brief sketch of the main
ideas. I prove it in detail below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Reduce to the $\ell$-primary case for odd prime $\ell>2$.
    \item
        Using Mazur's results, if $V$ is a $G$-irreducible subquotient of
        $J(\QQbar)[\ell^\infty]$ then the corresponding Galois representation
        is unramified away from $\ell N$.
    \item
        Ribet shows that $\TT/\ell \TT$ is generated by $T_p$ for $p\nmid \ell
        N$. So we only have to check that it for $T_p V\subseteq V$ for
        $p\nmid \ell$. An induction argument is needed to even make sense of
        $T_p$ as a well-defined function on $V$.
    \item
        For $p\nmid \ell N$, the reduction map
        $\tau:J(\QQbar)[\ell^\infty]\riso J_{/\Fp}(\Fpbar)[\ell^\infty]$ is an
        isomorphism.
    \item
        We can then work on the right hand side of the above isomorphism and
        use the Eichler-Shimura relation to write $T_p$ using $\Frob_p$. This
        does it since $V$ is a $G$-module.
\end{itemize}

The next steps should be to use~\cite[Corollary 4.8]{MR2342491} to establish
Theorem~\ref{theorem:non_eisen_iso_classify}. David Helm gives some fairly
general results so it shouldn't be too hard to use it. Though the hypothesis
needed are not all listed together so I need to be careful.


\subsection{Notations/Conventions/Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Let $N\geq 11$ be prime.
    \item
        Let $J=J_0(N)$
    \item
        Let $A$ be a simple abelian subvariety of $J$.
    \item
        Let $G=\Gal(\QQbar/\QQ)$. We often refer to $\ZZ[G]$-modules as simply
        $G$-modules.
    \item
        Let $\TT$ be the Hecke algebra associated to $J_0(N)$.
    \item
        Let $R=\TT[G]$.
    \item
        We usually reserve $\ell$ to be the exponent of an irreducible module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simple Galois subquotients of $J[\ell]$}

We begin by using Mazur's work to understand the $G$-subquotients of $J[\ell]$
for prime $\ell>2$.

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:irreducible_G_sub}
    Let $V$ be an irreducible $G$-subquotient of $J[\ell]$. Then either $V\cong_G
    J[\gM]$ for some non-Eisenstein maximal ideal of $\TT$ or $V$ is a
    subquotient of $J[\gM]$ for some Eisenstein maximal $\gM$ with $V$
    isomorphic as $G$-modules to either $\ZZ/\ell$ or $\mu_\ell$.

    We will call $V$ non-Eisenstein in the first case and Eisenstein in the
    second case. This terminology will be justified later when we show that
    irreducible $G$-submodules of $J[\ell]$ are $R$-module.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This is essentially~\cite[\S 14]{mazur:eisenstein}. We start by showing any
    irreducible $T[G]$-subquotient of $J[\ell]$ is also irreducible as a
    $G$-module and has the required form.

    Let $V$ be an irreducible $R$-module. Let $\gM$ be the annihilator of $V$
    in $\TT$. By Cherry Street work, $\gM$ is maximal. We have that $V$ is a
    subquotient of $J[\gM]$. Either $\gM$ is Eisenstein or non-Eisenstein.
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item
            If $\gM$ is Eisenstein, then the action of $\TT$ factors through
            $\ZZ$, so $V$ is irreducible as a $G$-module. By~\cite[Proposition
            14.1]{mazur:eisenstein}, $J[\gM]$ is admissible (meaning it has a
            $G$-composition series consisting of $\ZZ/\ell$ and $\mu_\ell$) so
            $V$ is isomorphic as $G$-module to either $\ZZ/\ell$ or $\mu_\ell$.
        \item
            If $\gM$ is non-Eisenstein, then by~\cite[Proposition
            14.2]{mazur:eisenstein} $J[\gM]$ is irreducible as a $G$-module.
            Hence, $V\cong J[\gM]$.
    \end{enumerate}
    This proves that any $R$-composition series of $J[\ell]$ is also a
    $G$-composition series of $J[\ell]$. The conclusion now follows from the
    Jordan-Holder Theorem.
\end{proof} 

We will soon be interested in using the Eichler-Shimura relation so we need to
understand the ramified of the corresponding Galois representations.
\begin{corollary}\label{corollary:unramified}
    Suppose $V$ is an irreducible subquotient of $J(\QQ)[\ell]$. Then the
    corresponding Galois representation is unramfied away from $\ell N$.
\end{corollary}
 

\subsection{Galois modules are Hecke modules}

The goal of this section is to prove
\begin{theorem}
    Suppose $K$ is a finite $G$-module supported away from $2$. Then $K$ is a
    $\TT$-module, meaning $K=\TT K$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to prove this for each $\ell$-primary part. Let $\ell>2$ and
    assume $K\subseteq J(\QQbar)[\ell^\infty]$. Let
    \[
        0 = K_0 \subseteq \ldots \subseteq K_n = K
    \]
    be a maximal $G$-composition series of $K$ with composition factors $X_i =
    K_i/K_{i-1}$. We proceed by induction on on $n$ with the base
    case being the trivial $n=0$ case. 
    
    Assume $K_{s-1}$ is an $R$-module. We will show $K_s$ is an $R$-module.
    Since $K_{s-1}$ is an $R$-module, for each $t\in \TT$, we have a
    well-defined map $t:X_s\to J(\QQbar)/K_{s-1}$. The goal is to show
    $t(X_s)\subseteq X_s$. Then by~\cite[Prop. 6.1]{MR1610883}, $\TT/\ell \TT$
    is generated by $T_p$ for $p\nmid \ell N$ so it suffices to show
    $T_p(X_s)\subseteq X_s$ for prime $p\nmid \ell N$.

    Fix a prime $p\nmid \ell N$. By Corollary~\ref{corollary:unramified}, the
    Galois representation associated to $X_s$ is unramified away from $\ell N$
    so let $\Frob_p$ be a choice of Frobenius. By the proof of~\cite[Lemma
    12.6.2]{ribet-stein:mod}, the reduction map induces an isomorphism
    \[
        \tau:J(\QQ)[\ell^\infty] \riso J_{/\F_p} (\Fpbar)[\ell^\infty].
    \]
    Under this isomorphism, we have that $\Frob_p$ corresponds to the Frobenius
    $F$ in $J_{/\F_p}$ (See~\cite[\S 5.3]{ribet-stein:serre}.) Hence,
    \[
    \tau(T_p X_s}) 
    = T_p\tau(X_s) 
    = (F+p/F)\tau(X_s)
    = \tau(\Frob_p+p/\Frob_p)X_s)
    \subseteq \tau(X_s)
    \]
    so $T_p X_s\subseteq X_s$, as desired.
\end{proof}

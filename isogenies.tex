\section{Enumerating Isogenies}

Let $N$ be prime, $J=J_0(N)$, and $A\subseteq J_\mathrm{new}$ be a simple
subvariety.  Let $\TT$ be the Hecke algebra of $J_0(N)$. Let $\Phi:A\to A'$ be
a $\QQ$-isogeny with kernel $K$. Let $G=\Gal(\QQbar/\QQ)$.

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $K$ is supported away from 2. Then $K$ is a $\TT[G]$-module.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $0=K_0\subseteq K_1\subseteq \cdots \subseteq K_m = K$ be a composition
    series of $K$. Let $X_i = K_i/K_{i-1}$ and $Y_i = \TT X_i$ for
    $i=1,\ldots,m$. It suffices to show that $X_i=Y_i$ for all $i$. Fix an $i$.
    Since $X_i$ is irreducible as a $G$-module, $Y_i$ is irreducible as a
    $\TT[G]$-module. Therefore, $\Ann_\TT Y_i$ is a maximal ideal of $\TT$
    which does not contain 2, by assumption. This implies that $Y_i$ is
    isomorphic as a $\TT[G]$-module to a subquotient of $A[M]$ and, hence,
    $J[M]$. We now consider the case where $M$ is Eisenstein and non-Eisenstein
    separately.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Suppose $M$ is Eisenstein. Then by~\cite[16.2, pg.
            125]{mazur:eisenstein}, $J[M] = C[p]\oplus\Sigma[p]$, where $p$ is
            the residue characteristic of $M$, $C$ is the cuspidal subgroup and
            $\Sigma$ is the Shimura subgroup.

            We first show that both $C[p]$ and $\Sigma[p]$ are $\TT[G]$-modules.
            Let $T\in \TT$ and $x \in C[p]\subseteq J[M]$. Then $T(x) = c+s$,
            where $c\in C$ and $s\in \Sigma$. For any $g\in G$,
            \[
                c+s = T(g(x)) = g(T(x)) = g(c+s) = g(c) + g(s) = c+g(s),
            \]
            but $\Sigma$ is $\mu$-type so $s=0$ and $C[p]$ is $\TT$-module.
            Similarly, let $T\in \TT$ and $y\in \Sigma[p]$. Then $T(y) = c+s$,
            where $c\in C$ and $s\in \Sigma$. Let $g\in G$ be such that $g(s) =
            (p-2)s$. Then
            \[
                (p-2)c + (p-2)s=T((p-2)y)=T(g(y)) = g(T(y)) = g(c+s) =
                g(c)+g(s) = c + (p-2)s,
            \]
            which implies $c=0$.

            The group $X_i$ is an irreducible $G$-subquotient of $J[M]$ so
            $X_i$ is isomorphic to some $G$-submodule of $C[p]$ or $\Sigma[p]$.
            In either case, since $C[p]$ and $\Sigma[p]$ are cyclic
            $\TT$-module, the $\TT$-action is scalar multiplication by an
            integer. Hence, $X_i = Y_i$.
        \item 
            Suppose $M$ is non-Eisenstein. Then by~\cite[14.12, pg.
            122]{mazur:eisenstein}, $J[M]$ is an irreducible $G$-module.
            Therefore, $X_i \cong J[M]$ so $X_i = Y_i$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
    Suppose $K$ is supported away from 2 and Eisenstein primes. Then the
    composition factors $X_i$ of $K$ are all isomorphic to $A[M_i]$ for some
    non-Eisenstein prime $M_i$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    This is just the previous proposition when we ignore the Eisenstein primes.
\end{proof}

And from here, I'm stuck. My hope is that in the non-Eisenstein case, I can find
an ideal $I$ of $\TT$ such that $K=A[I]$. From the previous proposition, 
we have that $K \subseteq A[\prod_i M_i]$ and I've been trying to
prove/convince myself this might be an equality.

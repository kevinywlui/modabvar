\section{Introduction}
In this paper, we lay the foundations for a computational theory of
abelian varieties over $\Q$ of $\GL_2$-type.  This will support
generalizing Cremona's highly influential tables \cite{cremona:algs}
of elliptic curves to higher dimension.  We describe algorithms for
enumerating and decomposing $\GL_2$-type abelian varieties,
isomorphism testing, computation of endomorphism and homomorphism
rings, arithmetic with finite subgroups, computation of the modular
degree, computing special values of $L$-functions, and computing
Tamagawa numbers.  None of our algorithms use defining equations for
varieties, and as such they work in a great degree of generality
allowing us to treat all dimensions uniformly.  There are also several
open problems that are suggested by this paper [[give
cross-references]].

As mentioned above, a distinctive feature of our approach is that we
do not use explicit defining equations. This is in stark contrast to the
approach taken by many previous papers and theses \cite{empirical}
that treat only small dimensions.  We also hope that some of the ideas
in this paper may be applicable to \cite{MR2282913} and
\cite{jordiquer}.  The methods in this paper are also used in the
forthcoming paper \cite{calegari-stein:eisenstein}.  The author has
implemented all of the algorithms described here, and they are
included in Sage (which is free open source software \cite{sage}).
[[Cite that whole French paper that does via ad hoc methods something
like we do just for $J_0(125)$.]]

In this paper we mostly ignore issues of computational complexity,
since our goal is to describe how it is {\em practical at all} to
compute explicitly with modular abelian varieties.  Except for [[...??
norm equations]], the algorithm discussed in this paper mostly amount
to linear algebra and have complexity that is polynomial time in the
level $N$ of the abelian variety.

\subsection{$\GL_2$-type and Modular Abelian Varieties}
A simple abelian variety $A$ over $\Q$ is of \defn{$\GL_2$-type} if
$\End(A)\tensor\Q$ is a number field of degree equal to $\dim(A)$.
More generally an abelian variety is of $\GL_2$-type if it is
isogenous to a product of copies of simple abelian varieties of
$\GL_2$-type.  Let $X_1(N)$ be the modular curve that parametrizes
isomorphism classes of pairs $(E,P)$, where $E$ is an elliptic curve
and $P$ is a point of order $N$, and let $J_1(N)$ be the Jacobian of
$X_1(N)$, which is an abelian variety over $\Q$.  An abelian variety
$A$ over $\QQ$ is \defn{modular} if there is a homomorphism $A \to
J_1(N)$ with finite kernel.

Ribet observed in \cite[\S3]{ribet:abvars} that every modular abelian
variety is of $\GL_2$-type.  His paper also shows
\cite[Thm.~4.4]{ribet:abvars} that Serre's conjectures
\cite{serre:conjectures} on modularity of odd irreducible
two-dimensional mod~$p$ Galois representations imply the converse.
Since Khare and Wintenberger have now completely proved Serre's
conjecture, we have the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}[Khare, Wintenberger]\label{conj:ribmod}
Every $\GL_2$-type abelian variety over $\Q$ is modular.
\end{theorem}
Thus to explicitly compute with abelian varieties of $\GL_2$-type it
suffices to consider modular abelian varieties, which we do for the
rest of this paper.



\begin{remark}
  In this paper we only consider modular abelian varieties defined
  over~$\Q$.  It would be interesting to use similar methods to treat
  the general case of modular abelian varieties over a number field
  $K$, by which we mean abelian varieties $A$ over $K$ for which there
  exists a finite degree morphism $A\to J_1(N)$ over $K$ for some
  $N$. The main complication is that the endomorphism ring over
  $\Qbar$ of a simple modular abelian variety $A$ over $\Q$ need not
  be commutative.  Fortunately much is known about its structure (see
  \cite{ribet:twistsendoalg}).

  Also many of the algorithms in this paper naturally generalize to
  the context of Grothendieck motives attached to modular forms.  This
  is also a topic for future investigation.
\end{remark}



\subsection{Explicit Defining Data for Modular Abelian Varieties}
We represent modular abelian varieties over $\QQ$ {\em explicitly} as
follows. Let $J$ be an arbitrary finite product of modular Jacobians
$J_H(N)=\Jac(X_H(N))$ for subgroups $H\subset (\Z/N\Z)^*$, where
$N$ is a positive integer (see, e.g, \cite{} for the definition
of $J_H(N)$).   We will refer to $J$ as an \emph{ambient modular abelian
variety}.
Fix a modular abelian variety $A$ and a
finite degree homomorphism $\vphi: A\to J$.  Then there is an isogeny
from the image $B$ of $A$ in $J$ back to $A$ whose kernel we denote by
$G$, so $A$ is isomorphic to $B/G$ and $B\subset J$:
$$
\xymatrix{
   & & J & & \\
   0\ar[r]& G \ar[r]& B\ar@{^(->}[u] \ar[r]& A\ar[r] \ar@/^/[l]\ar[ul]_{f} & 0
}
$$
In other words we can represent any modular abelian variety by giving
$G\subset B\subset J$, all defined over $\QQ$.  It remains to explain
how we explicitly specify $B$ and $G$.

{\em We specify $B$ as follows.}  The inclusion $B \hookrightarrow J$
induces an inclusion of rational homology $\H_1(B, \Q) \hookrightarrow
\H_1(J, \Q)$ and $B$ is determined by the image $V$ of $\H_1(B,\Q)$ in
the $\Q$-vector space $\H_1(J,\Q)$.  We explicitly compute a basis for
$\H_1(J,\Z)$ and $\H_1(J,\Q)=\H_1(J,\Z)\tensor \QQ$ using modular
symbols \cite{stein:modform}, and specify $B$ by giving a basis in
reduced echelon form for a subspace $V \subset \H_1(J, \Q)$.  Of
course, not every subspace corresponds to a modular abelian variety,
but we can determine whether or not a given $V$ corresponds to a valid
abelian subvariety (see \ref{}).

{\em We specify $G$ as follows.}
Suppose $V$ defines an abelian subvariety $B$ of $J$ as above.
By the Abel-Jacobi theorem, we have
$$
 J(\C) \cong \H_1(J, \R) / \H_1(J,\Z),
$$
and letting $\Lambda = \H_1(J,\Z) \cap V$ we have
$B(\C) \cong (V\tensor\R) / \Lambda$.
In particular,
$$
  B(\C)_{\tor} \cong V/\Lambda,
$$
and we specify $G\subset B(\C)_{\tor}$ by giving the lattice $L$ with
$\Lambda \subset L\subset V$ such that $L/\Lambda \isom G$.

%giving a finite list $g_i$ of
%elements of $V$ that generate the elementary factors.  More precisely,
%$G \isom \bigoplus \Z/n_i\Z$ can be written uniquely (up to choice of
%generators for cyclic factors) as a direct sum of cyclic abelian groups with
%$n_1\mid n_2\ldots$, and we choose the $g_i$ to correspond to the
%vectors $(1,0,\ldots,0), \ldots, (0,0,\ldots,1)$ of elements in $\bigoplus
%\Z/n_i\Z$. [[possibly make unique somehow??]]

For brevity, henceforth we use the term {\em modular abelian variety}
to mean a modular (or equivalently $\GL_2$-type) abelian variety $A$
that has been given explicitly by a triple $(V,L,J)$ where $V\subset
\H_1(J,\QQ)$, the lattice $L\subset V$ contains $\Lambda = V\cap
\H_1(J,\ZZ)$, and $J$ is specified by a finite ordered list of
congruence subgroups $\Gamma_0(N)$, $\Gamma_1(N)$, and $\Gamma_H(N)$.
We use the notation $(V,J)$ as a shorthand for $L=\Lambda$.



\section{Computing with Modular Abelian Varieties}

modular symbols; $\Gamma_H(N)$.


\subsection{Enumerating New Simple Modular Abelian Varieties}

\begin{algorithm}{Enumerate Modular Abelian Varieties}
  Given a modular Jacobian $J$ this algorithm outputs a list of
  abelian subvarieties of $J$ in each isogeny class of simple modular
  abelian varieties of level $N$.
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Decomposition}
\subsubsection{New and Old Subvarieties and Quotients}

\begin{algorithm}{Decomposition of modular Jacobians}
    \label{decomp_jacobian}
    Let $J=J_1(N)$ with Hecke algebra $\T$. This algorithm will give a sequence
    of abelian subvarieties $A_i$ with finite intersection and sums to $J$. Let
    $L_1,\ldots, L_r$ be the divisors of $N$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Compute new modular symbols space]
            For each divisor $L_i$, compute the new modular symbol space
            $\mathbb{M}_2(L_i)_\mathrm{new}$ using the techniques in \cite[\S
            8]{stein:modform}.
        \item{} [Factor into Hecke eigenspaces]
            The new modular symbol space decomposes into 1-dimensional complex
            simultaneous eigenspaces for $\T$. So for each divisor $L_i$, we can
            factor the new modular symbols space by computing the eigenspaces
            with respect to a sufficiently generic element of the Hecke algebra.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item{} [Randomly pick from Hecke Algebra]
                    Randomly pick $T\in \T$.
                \item{} [Factor characteristic polynomial]
                    Let $\prod f_j ^{e_j}$ be a factorization of the characteristic
                    polynomial of $T$ so that each $f_j$ is irreducible and
                    distinct.
                \item{} [Irreducible?]
                    If any $e_j \geq 3$, return to step (a). Otherwise, Compute
                    the eigenspace decomposition $\{W_{ik}\}$ of
                    $\mathbb{M}_2(L_i)_\mathrm{new}$
            \end{enumerate}
        \item{} [Return image under degeneracy maps]
            For each divisor $L_i$, and each divisor $t_{il}$ of $N/L_i$,
            compute image $d_{L_i, t_{il}}(W_{ik})$. Return the sequence
            $(d_{L_i, t_{il}}(W_{ik}), J)$. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{Decomposition as a Product of Simples}


\begin{algorithm}{Decompose as Product}
    Given a modular abelian variety $A=(L, V, J)$, this algorithm finds simple
    abelian varieties $B_i$ and an isogeny $A\to \prod B_i$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Decompose $J$]
            Decompose $J$ into simple subvarieties $X_1,\ldots,X_r$ with
            $X_i=(V_i, J)$.
        \item{} [Classify subvarieties]
            Find abelian subvarieties $E, F$ of $J$ such that $E+F=J$, $E\cap
            F$ is finite, and the composition $B \to J \to J/E$ is an isogeny.
            This is done as follows:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item{} [Ascending sequence]
                    Compute $D_j = \left(\sum_{k=1} ^j V_k \right)\cap V$ for
                    $j=0,\ldots,r$.
                \item{} [Classify]
                    Let $S_0 = \{j: \dim D_j = \dim D_{j-1}\}$ and $S_1 = \{j:
                    \dim D_j > \dim D_{j-1}\}$.
                \item{} [Form subvarieties]
                    Compute $E = \sum_{j \in S_0} X_j$ and $F = \sum_{j\in S_1}
                    X_j$.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item{} [Isogeny to $F$]
            Use Algorithm~\ref{?} to compute the projection map $\pi_F:J \to F$
            and compose this with the inclusion map $B\to J$ to form $\Phi:B\to
            F$.
        \item{} [Pullback]
            Return $\{(L_j, V_j, J)\}_{j\in S_1}$, where $V_j = \Phi^{-1}(V_F)$
            and $L_j = L\cap V_j$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}



\subsubsection{Verifying Defining Data of a Modular Abelian Variety}


As mentioned in the introduction, not every subspace $V$ of $H_1(J, \QQ)$
corresponds to a subvariety of $J$. We can use the following proposition to
determine if $V$ does correspond to a subvariety.

\begin{proposition}
    Let $A$ be a simple subvariety of $J_1(N)$. From the work of Shimura,
    there exists a divisor $L$ of $N$ and a newform $f$ of level $L$ such that
    $A_f \sim A$. Let $d_1,\ldots,d_r$ be the full collection of degeneracy
    maps from $J_0(L)$ to $J_0(N)$. Then there exists integers $n_1,\ldots,n_r$
    such that
    \[
        A = 
        \left(\sum_{i=1} ^r n_i d_i\right)
        A_f.
    \]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\Lambda_A = H_1(A)$, $\Lambda_f=H_1(A_f)$, $V_A=H_1(A, \QQ)$, and
    $V_f=H_1(A_f, \QQ)$. Since $A \subseteq \sum_{i=1} ^r d_i(A_f)$, there
    exists $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_r\in \End(A_f/\QQ)$ such that 
    \[
        A = 
        \left(\sum_{i=1} ^r d_i \circ \sigma_i\right) A_f.
    \]
    But $A_f$ is a simple modular abelian variety so there exists a number
    field $K_f$ and $a_1,\ldots,a_r$ such that
    \[
        A = 
        \left(\sum_{i=1} ^r a_i d_i\right) A_f.
    \]
    This induces a map $\Phi:V_f\to V_A$ given by $\Phi:\sum_{i=1} ^r a_i d_i$
    such that $\Phi(\Lambda_f)\subseteq \Lambda_A$. Consequently, $a_i\in \QQ$
    for all $i$. Since abelian varieties are divisible, we can clear
    denominators from the $a_i$'s to obtain integers $n_i$'s such that
    \[
        A = 
        \left(\sum_{i=1} ^r n_i d_i\right)
        A_f.
    \]
\end{proof}


\begin{algorithm}{Verifying subspace correponds to subvariety}
    Let $J=J_1(N)$ and $V$ be a subspace of $H_1(J, \QQ)$. This algorithm will
    return True if $V$ corresponds to an abelian subvariety of $J$ and
    False otherwise. Let $\T=\{T_1,\ldots\}$ be the Hecke algebra of $J$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Decompose into potential Hecke eigenspaces] 
            We first decompose $V$ into a direct sum $V=W_1\oplus \cdots \oplus
            W_r$ so that, for each $W_i$, there exists a newform $f_i$ of level
            dividing $N$, such that either $W_i$ either corresponds to an
            abelian subvariety isogenous to a power of $A_{f_i}$ or is not an
            abelian subvariety and we can return False.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item{} [Initialize]
                    Set $j=1$.
                \item{} [Decompose into eigenspaces]
                    Compute the simultaneous eigenspaces $U_{j,1},\ldots,U_{j,
                    n_j}$ of $\{T_1,\ldots,T_j\}$. If $\sum_{k=1} ^{n_j}
                    U_{j, k}\neq V$, return False.
                \item{} [Compare with newforms]
                    Let $S_{j,k}$ be the set of newforms whose $l$th Fourier
                    coefficent agrees with the eigenvalue of $T_l$ on $U_{j,
                    k}$ for $l=1,\ldots,j$. If $S_{j, k}$ is empty for any
                    $k=1,\ldots,n_j$, return False. If $S_{j,k}$ is not
                    singleton for any $k=1,\ldots, n_j$, increment $j$ and
                    return to (b).  Otherwise, $S_{j,k}$ is singleton for all
                    $k$ so let $S_{j,k}=\{f_k\}$ and $W_k=U_{j,k}$.
            \end{enumerate}
        \item{} [Is isogenous to power?]
            We now verify that each $W_i$ is isogenous to a power of $A_{f_i}$.
            Since we will be doing this individually for each $W_i$, we will
            consider just a single pair $W$ and $A_f$ with $f$ being a newform
            of level $L$. Let $d_1,\ldots,d_r:J_1(L)\to J_1(N)$ be the full
            collection of degeneracy maps from $J_1(L)$ to $J_1(N)$.  Set
            $U=\{0\}$.
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item{} [Image of $\QQ$-combination of $d_j$'s?]
                    Choose any $v\in V\setminus U$. Find $q_1,\ldots,q_r$
                    such that $v\in \Im \left(\sum_{i=1} ^r q_i
                    \delta_i\right)$. If this is not possible, return
                    False. Let $R = \Im \left(\sum_{i=1} ^r q_i
                    \delta_i\right)$. If $R\not\subseteq V$, return False.  
                \item{} [Full space?]
                    Replace $U$ with $U+R$. If $V=U$, we are done. Otherwise,
                    return to (b).
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Arithmetic with Modular Abelian Varieties}

\subsubsection{Sums and Products}

Suppose $B=(V, L, J)$ is a modular abelian variety with subvarieties $A_1=(W_1,
L_1, J)$ and $A_2=(W_2, L_2, J)$. Then the sum $A_1+A_2\subseteq B$ is given by
$(W_1+W_2, L_3, J)$ with $L_3$ given by $L_3 = L\cap (W_1+W_2)$.

Suppose $B_1=(V_1, L_1, J_1)$ and $B_2=(V_2, L_2, J_2)$ are modular abelian
varieties with subvarieties $A_1=(W_1, L_1, J_1)\subseteq B_1$ and $A_2=(W_2,
L_2, J_2)\subseteq B_2)$. Then the product $A_1\times A_2\subseteq B_1\times
B_2$ is given by $(W_1\times W_2, L_1\times L_2, J_1\times J_2)$.

\subsubsection{Intersection}


Suppose $A = (V,J)$ and $A' = (V', J)$ are abelian subvarieties of a
common ambient $J$.  Then $A\cap A'$ is an extension of the abelian
variety $(A\cap A')^0 = (V\cap V', J)$ by a finite component group:
$$
\xymatrix{
   & & J & & \\
   0\ar[r]& (A\cap A')^0 \ar[r]&  A\cap A'\ar@{^(->}[u] \ar[r]& \Phi\ar[r] & 0,
}
$$
The component group is isomorphic to the torsion subgroup of kernel of
the map $A \times A' \to J$ sending $(x,y)\to x-y$, which we compute
using Section~\ref{sec:kernelmodabvar}; in particular, we have
$$
   \Phi \isom \left( \Lambda_J/(\Lambda_A + \Lambda_A')\right)_{\tor}.
$$
If $A$ and $A'$ are preserved by $\End(J)$, then $\End(J)$ also
acts on $\Phi$ via its action on $\Lambda_J$.


\subsubsection{Complements (Poincare Reducibility)}\label{sec:poincare}

Let $J=J_1(N)$ be principally polarized with the $\Theta$-divisor associated to
a non-degenerate Riemannian form $H$. Let $A=(V, J)$ be a subvariety of $J$.
Poincare Reducibility states that the orthogonal complement $V'$ with respect
to $H$ corresponds to an abelian subvariety $A'$ such that $A+A'=J$ and $A\cap
A'$ is finite. The Riemmannian form $H$ is completely determined the image part of
its restriction to $\Lambda_J$ which is, in turn, given by
\[
    \Im H(\gamma_1, \gamma_2) = \langle \gamma_1, \gamma_2 \rangle,
\]
where $\gamma_1, \gamma_2\in H_1(J)$ and $\langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle$ is the
intersection pairing on $\Lambda_J$.

The goal now is to describe an algorithm for computing the intersection pairing
as described by Verrill~\cite[\S 4]{verrill:intersection}
Every modular symbol of $M_2(\Gamma_1(N))$ can be as
\[
    \sum_{g\in \SL_2{\ZZ}} g\{0, \infty\}
\] 
using Manin symbols. Let $\rho=(1+i\sqrt{3})/2$. Then every modular symbol of
$S_2(\Gamma_1(N))$ can be written as
\[
    \sum_{h\in \SL_2{\ZZ}} h\{\rho, \rho^2\}.
\]
using~\cite[Corollary 4.1]{verrill:intersection}. The intersection pairing is
then given on these summands by
\[
    \langle g\{0,\infty\}, h\{\rho, \rho^2\} \rangle 
    =
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } g\sim_\Gamma h \\
        -1 & \text{if } g\sim_\Gamma Sh \\
        0 & \text{if } g\not\sim_\Gamma h,
    \end{cases}
\]
where $S= \left(\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.

\begin{algorithm}{Complement (Poincare Reducibility)}
    Let $A=(V, J_1(N))$ be an abelian subvariety of $J_1(N)$. This algorithm
    computes the complement of $A$ given by Poincare Reducibility.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Riemmannian form]
            Use the discussion above compute the Riemannian form $H$ associated
            to $J$.
        \item{} [Complement]
            Compute the orthogonal complement $V'$ of $V$ with respect to $H$
            and return $A'=(V', J_1(N))$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{Quotients by Subgroups and Subvarieties}

\label{sec:quotients}

Suppose $A = (V, L, J)$ is a modular abelian variety and $A' = (V',
L', J)$ is an abelian subvariety of $A$, so $V\subset V'$ and $L' =
L\cap V'$.  Using Section~\ref{sec:poincare}, we compute $A/A'$ by
finding a complement $B=(V_B,L_B,J)$ of $A'$ in $A$ along with
surjective projection maps $\pi_{A'}: A \to A'$ and $\pi_B: A\to B$.
Then the identity component of $A/A'$ is isomorphic to $B$.  The
component group $\Phi$ of $A/A'$ is isomorphic to the identity
component of the kernel of the natural map $A \to B$, which we compute
using Section~\ref{sec:kernelmodabvar}.

\subsection{Finite Subgroups}


\subsubsection{Defining Data}

Let $A=(V, L, J)$ be a modular abelian variety. A finite subgroup $G$ of $A$
can be specified by giving a defining lattice $\mathcal{L}$ such that
$\mathcal{L}/L = G$ and a field of definition $K$ of $G$ as a group scheme. 

Given 2 finite subgroups $G_1=(\mathcal{L}_1, K_1, A)$ and $G_2=(\mathcal{L}_2,
K_2, A)$, a map $\phi: G_1\to G_2$ can be given as a map on the defining
lattices.


\subsubsection{The $n$-Torsion Subgroup}

Let $A=(V, L, J)$ be a modular abelian variety. The $n$-torsion subgroup is
given by $(\frac{1}{n} L, \QQ, A)$.



\subsubsection{Intersection of Finite Subgroups}

Let $G=(\mathcal{L}_1, K_1, A)$ and $H=(\mathcal{L}_2, K_2, A)$ be finite
subgroups of an modular abelian variety $A=(L, V, J)$. Let $\mathcal{L}_1 ' =
\mathcal{L}_1+L$ and $\mathcal{L}_2 ' = \mathcal{L}_2 + L$. Then the
intersection $G\cap H$ is the group $(\mathcal{L}, K_1K_2, A)$, where
$\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_1\cap \mathcal{L}_2 \cap V$.

\subsubsection{Sums of Finite Subgroups}

Let $G=(\mathcal{L}_1, K_1, A)$ and $H=(\mathcal{L}_2, K_2, A)$ be finite
subgroups of $A=(L, V, J)$. The sum is given by $G+H=(\mathcal{L}_1 +
\mathcal{L}_2+L, K_1K_2, A)$.

\subsubsection{Quotients of Finite Subgroups}

Let $G=(\mathcal{L}_1, K_1, A)$ and $H=(\mathcal{L}_2, K_2, A)$ be finite
subgroups of $A=(L, V, J)$ with $H\subseteq G$ so $\mathcal{L}_2\subseteq
\mathcal{L}_1$. The quotient is given by $G/H=(\mathcal{L}_1/\mathcal{L}_2,
K_1K_2, A/H)$, where the computation of $A/H$ is given in
Section~\ref{sec:quotients}.


\subsubsection{The Cuspidal Subgroup}

The cusps of $X_1(N)$ are the equivalence classes of $\P^1(\QQ)$ under
$\Gamma_1(N)$. We will denote the elements by $[x/y]_{\Gamma_1}$. The
\defn{cuspidal subgroup} $C$ of $J$ is the subgroup of degree-0 divisors
$(\alpha)-(\beta)$ where $\alpha, \beta$ are cusps on $J$. More generally, if
$A=(L, V, J)$ is a modular abelian variety that is the quotient of $B$ by $L$.
Then the cuspidal subgroup of $A$ is defined to be $(C\cap B)/L$, where $C$ is
the cuspidal subgroup of $J$. 

The Galois structure of the cuspidal subgroup is well-understood~\cite[\S
1.3]{MR670070}. The points of the cuspidal subgroup are $\QQ(\mu_N)$-rational
with the following galois action. The Galois $\Gal(\QQ(\mu_N)/\QQ)\cong
\ZZ/N\ZZ)^*$, let
\[
    \sigma_d\in \Gal(\Q(\mu_N)/\Q):\mu_N\mapsto \mu_N ^d
\]
then
\[
    \sigma_d([x/y]_{\Gamma_1})=[x/d'y]_{\Gamma_1},
\]
where $dd'\equiv 1 \mod{N}$. With this, we are able to compute the
\emph{rational cuspidal subgroup} $C(\QQ):=C^{\Gal(\QQ(\mu)/\QQ)}$.

\subsubsection{The Rational Torsion Subgroup}

divisor, multiple of order


In general 

An upper bound can be
..william's thing..

\subsubsection{The Shimura Subgroup}

For any integer $N$, there exists a map between modular curves given
on the non-cuspidal points by
\begin{align*}
    s_N: X_1(N) & \to X_0(N) \\
    [E, P]      & \mapsto [E, \langle P \rangle].
\end{align*}
By Pic functoriality, this induces a map $s_N ^*: J_0(N)\to J_1(N)$. The
kernel of this map is the \emph{Shimura subgroup}, denoted $\Sigma(N)$. Ribet
shows that for any prime $p$ coprime to $N$, $\Sigma(N)=\ker(\delta_1
^*-\delta_p ^*)$, where $\delta_1^*, \delta_p ^*:J_0(N)\to J_0(pN)$ are the
degeneracy maps. So computing the Shimura subgroup amounts to compute the
kernel of $(\delta_1 ^* - \delta_p ^*)$.

\subsection{Morphisms Between Modular Abelian Varieties}



\subsubsection{Defining Data for Morphisms}

Let $A=(L, V, J)$ and $B=(L', V', J')$ be modular abelian varieties and
$\Phi:A\to B$ a map of abelian varieties. Then $\Phi$ induces a map on rational
homology and is also completely determined by the map on rational homology.
So we will defined $\Phi:A\to B$ by giving the pair $(\Phi_V, K)$, where
$\Phi_V:V\to V'$ and a field of definition $K$ of $\Phi$. When clear by
context, we will use $\Phi$ to denote both the map on abelian varieties and on
rational homology.

\subsubsection{Natural Maps}

The Hecke operators~\cite[\S 8.3]{stein:modform}, degeneracy maps~\cite[\S
8.6]{stein:modform}, and star involution~\cite[\S 8.5]{stein:modform} are
useful maps defined on modular symbols which, in turn, induce maps on the
Jacobian.

\subsubsection{Morphisms Defined by Finite Subgroups}

\subsubsection{Kernels of Morphisms}\label{sec:kernelmodabvar}

Let $\Phi:A\to B$ be a morphism between modular abelian varieties $A=(L, V, J)$
and $B=(L', V', J')$. Let $V_K=\ker \phi_V$ and $L_K=L\cap V_K$. Then the
kernel $K$ of $\phi$ is the extension of the abelian variety $K^0 = (L_K, V_K,
J)$ by a finite component group $G$. The group $G$ is given by...

\subsubsection{Images of Morphisms}

\begin{algorithm}{Image of Morphisms}
    \label{alg:image}
    Let $\Phi:A\to B$ be a morphism between modular abelian varieties $A=(L, V,
    J)$ and $B=(L', V', J')$. This algorithm will compute the image of $\Phi$
    which is again a modular abelian variety.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Image of rational homology]
            Compute the image $V''$ of $\Phi$ on $V$.
        \item{} [Intersect lattice]
            Compute the intersection $L''=L'\cap V''$.
        \item{} [Return the image]
            Return the modular abelian variety $C=(L'', V'', J')$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{The Universal Property of the Cokernel}

The universal property of the cokernel is given by this diagram:

[here is a diagram]

\begin{algorithm}{Cokernel}
    Let $\Phi:A\to B$ be a morphism between modular abelian varieties $A=(L, V,
    J)$ and $B=(L', V', J')$. This algorithm will return the cokernel $C$ of
    $\Phi$ as well as the induced map $A\to C$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Compute image]
            Use Algorithm~\ref{alg:image} to compute the image of $\Phi$.
        \item{} [Return quotient]
            Use \ref{quotients} to compute quotient $C:=B/\Im
            \Phi$ and the induced map $A\to C$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}


\subsubsection{The Projection Morphism} 

Let $A=(L, V, J)$ be a modular abelian variety with subvarieties $B_1=(L_1,
V_1, J)$ and $B_2=(L_2, V_2, J)$ such that $B_1+B_2=A$ and $B_1\cap B_2$
finite. A projection morphism is a surjective map $\pi:A\to B_1$ with $(\ker
pi)^0 = B_2$. This morphism is not unique.

\begin{algorithm}{Computing Projection Morphism}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{} [Basis for lattice]
            Let $\{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n\}$, $\{u_1,\ldots,u_r\}$, and
            $\{v_1,\ldots,v_s\}$ be bases for the defining lattices of $A, B_1,
            B_2$, respectively.
        \item{} [Project]
            For each $i$, write $\lambda_i=u_i+v_i$, where $u_i\in B_1$ and
            $v_i\in B_2$ are torsion. This is possible because $A=B_1+B_2$
            though not unique unless $B_1\cap B_2$ is trivial.
        \item{} [Return map]
            Return the map $\phi$ given by the formula $\phi(\lambda_i)=u_i$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Left and Right Inverses}



\subsection{Endomorphism Rings and Hom Spaces}

\subsubsection{Computing End and Hom}

The following saturation algorithm will be important
when computing $\End(A)$ and $\Hom(A,B)$.

[[insert very quick summary of Hermite and smith forms]]

[[this should go in paper on hnf, etc. writing with
Clement Pernet]]

\begin{algorithm}{Saturate}
Given a subgroup $L$ of $\Z^n$, this algorithm computes
the saturation $(\Q L) \cap \Z^n$ of $L$ in $\Z^n$.
Let $M$ be a matrix whose rows are a $\Z$-basis for $L$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} [Hermite Normal Form] Find the Hermite Normal Form $H$ of $M^t$.
\item{} [Inverse] Compute $S = (H^t)^{-1} M$ using the ``last big row'' trick.
Then output $S$ whose rows are a basis for the saturation of $L$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to prove that $(H^t)^{-1}M$ has rows that span the
saturation of the row span of $M$.
[...]
\end{proof}

Note that one could instead replace $H$ by an LLL reduced basis for
the rowspace of $M^t$, but this is usually much slower because the
$p$-adic/modular algorithm \cite{blah} for computing Hermite normal
form is fast.


If $A$ is an abelian variety of dimension $2$ then after chosing a basis for
$\Lambda = \H_1(A,\Z)$, we have
$$
  \End(\Lambda)\isom \Mat_{2d\times 2d}(\Z) \ncisom \Z^{(2d)^2}.
$$

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:end}
Let $A$ be a simple abelian variety over a number field $K$,
let $\Lambda = \H_1(A,\Z)$ and
embed $\End(A/K)$ in $\End(\Lambda)$
by the action of endomorphisms on homology.   Then
$$
  \End(A/K) = (\End(A/K)\tensor \Q)\cap \End(\Lambda),
$$
where  the intersection takes place in $\End(\Lambda)\tensor\Q$.
\end{proposition}
We will use the following lemma in the proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:end}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:gal}
  Let $K$ be a number field.  If an element $x\in \C$ is fixed by
  every element of $\Aut(\C/K)$, then $x\in K$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  If $x\in\Kbar$, this is standard Galois theory.  If $x\not\in
  \Kbar$, then $x$ is transcendental.  Since $x+1$ is also transcendental,
the fields $\Kbar(x)$ and $\Kbar(x+1)$ are isomorphic via a map $\sigma$
sending $x$ to $x+1$.  Every automorphism of a subfield of $\C$
extends to $\C$, so $\sigma$ extends to an automorphism of $\C$
that does not fix~$x$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{prop:end}]
An element of $\End(A/\C)$ is just
a complex linear map on $\Tan(A_\C)$  that preserves $\Lambda$.
The inclusion of $\End(A/K)$ in the right hand side is obvious,
so suppose $\vphi \in (\End(A/K)\tensor \Q)\cap \End(\Lambda)$.
Then there is a positive integer $n$ such that $n\vphi\in \End(A/K)$.
Thus $n\vphi\in \End(A/K)\tensor\Q$ induces a complex-linear endomorphism of $\Tan(A_\C)$,
so $\vphi = (1/n)n\vphi $ also induces a complex-linear endomorphism of $\Tan(A_\C)$;
also, by hypothesis $\vphi$ preserves $\Lambda$.
Thus $\vphi\in\End(A/\C)$.

There is a nonzero integer $n$ such that $n\vphi$ is defined over $K$,
so for any $\sigma\in\Gal(\C/K)$, we have $\sigma([n]\vphi) - [n]\vphi
= 0$.  But
$$\sigma([n]\vphi) = \sigma([n])\sigma(\vphi) = [n]\sigma(\vphi),$$
so
$$[n](\sigma(\vphi) - \vphi) = 0,$$
which implies $\sigma(\vphi)=\vphi$, since the kernel of $[n]$ is
finite and the image of $\sigma(\vphi)-\vphi$ is either infinite or
$0$.  By Lemma~\ref{lem:gal}, $\vphi\in \End(A/K)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{algorithm}{Endomorphism Algebra as Field}
    Given a simple modular abelian variety $A$ over $\Q$,
    this algorithm computes a number field $F$ and an
    isomorphism $\End(A)\tensor\Q \to F$.
\begin{enumerate}
%\item{} [Field?] Check if $\End(A)$ is a field and quit if it is not.

\item{} [Find $A_f$] Using Algorithm~\ref{} find an isogeny $\vphi:A\to A_f$,
where $A_f$ is a newform abelian variety.

\item{} [Choose random endomorphism] Randomly pick [[how??]] an endomorphism
  $\varphi$ of $A_f$ and compute its minimal polynomial $g$.
\item{} [Does endomorphism generate?]
If $\deg g$ = $\dim(A_f)$, then let $F$ be the
number field generated by a root~$\alpha$ of $g$.
Otherwise, go to step 1.
\item{} [Define an isomorphism] Let $\Psi$ be the unique field
  homomorphism $\End(A_f)\tensor\Q \to F$ that sends~$\varphi$
  to~$\alpha$.  Compose this with the isomorphism
$\End(A)\tensor\Q \to \End(A_f)\tensor\Q$ induced by $\vphi$
to obtain the desired isomorphism.

\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
%"Most" choices of $\varphi$ will have characteristic polynomial of degree
%$\dim(A)$, so in practice finding such $\varphi$ is easy. Then we build
%$K$ using the primitive element theorem.

By \cite[???]{ribet:abvars} because $A$ is simple, modular, and defined over $\Q$,
we know that $\End(A)\tensor\Q$ is a number
field of degree equal to $\dim(A)$.  (If we instead consider $\End(A/\Qbar)$,
then $\End(A/\Qbar)\tensor\Q$ could be a non-commutative division algebra.
Again we emphasize that by definition $\End(A)$ contains only the endomorphisms
of $A$ that are defined over $\QQ$.)

By the primitive element theorem, there exists a $\varphi$ such that
if $f$ is the minimal polynomial of~$\varphi$, then
$\deg(f) = \dim(A)$.
Then since $\deg(f) = \dim(A)$ it follows that the
map $\Psi$ is an isomorphism (a nonzero homomorphism between number
fields of the same dimension is an isomorphism).
\end{proof}
% This is where probability of choosing a primitive
%element at random comes in...  This is CERTAINLY already already
%analyzed somewhere in the literature.

\begin{algorithm}{Compute $\End(A)$}
Given a simple modular abelian variety $A$, this algorithm
computes $\End(A)$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} [Find Modular Form] Since $A$ is simple we can use
  Algorithm~\ref{} to find a newform $f$ such that $A$ is isogenous to
  the abelian variety $A_f$.  It suffices to compute $\End(A)\tensor\Q
  = \End(A_f)\tensor\Q$, since by Proposition~\ref{prop:end} this
  yields $\End(A)$.  Thus it suffices to compute $\End(A_f)$.
\item{} [Initialize] Let $d=\dim(A_f)$, let $n=1$, and let $V$ be the
  zero subspace of $\End(A_f)\tensor\Q$.
\item{} [Compute Hecke operator]\label{step:heckeop} Using
  Algorithm~\ref{}, compute the restriction of the Hecke operator
  $T_n$ to $A_f$, as an element of $\End(A_f)\tensor\Q$.
\item{} [Increase $V$] Replace $V$ by $V+\Q\cdot T_n$.
\item{} [Finished?]  If $\dim(V) < d$, increase $n$ and go to
  Step~\ref{step:heckeop}.
\item{} [Saturate] Compute $\End(A_f/\Q) = V \cap \End(\Lambda_{A_f})$
  using Algorithm~\ref{}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
  We need to show that the algorithm terminates, i.e., that the Hecke
  algebra generates $\End(A_f/\Q) \tensor \Q$. But by
  \cite[Thm.~1]{shimura:factors} the image of $T \tensor \Q$ in
  $\End(A_f/\Q) \tensor \Q$ is a subfield of degree $\dim A_f$. But
  $A_f$ is simple by \cite[Cor.~4.2]{ribet:twistsendoalg}, so
  \cite[Thm.~2.1]{ribet:abvars} implies that $\End(A_f/\Q) \tensor \Q$
  also has dimension $\dim(A_f)$. Thus the Hecke algebra generates
  $\End(A_f/\Q) \tensor \Q$. By Proposition~\ref{prop:end} once we
  have $\End(A_f/\Q) \tensor \Q$ we apply Algorithm~\ref{} to get
  $\End(A_f/\Q)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{algorithm}{Compute $\Hom(A,B)$}
Given  modular abelian varieties $A$ and $B$, we
compute $\Hom(A,B)$ as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} [Factorizations]
By Proposition~\ref{prop:end} it suffices to explain how
to compute $\Hom(A,B)\tensor \Q$.
For this, we compute using Algorithm~\ref{}
  factorizations $\prod_{i \in I} C_i^{e_i}$ and $\prod_{i \in I}
  C_i^{f_i}$ of $A$ and $B$ up to isogeny (with isogenies)
respectively, where $I$ is some index set,
  the $C_i's$ are non-isogenous simple abelian varieties, and $e_i,
  f_i \geq 0$.  For the rest of this algorithm
we replace $A$, $B$, by these products.
\item{} [Simple case]\label{step:simplecase} When $A \sim C^e$ and $B \sim D^f$, where $C, D$ are simple
abelian varieties we compute $\Hom(A,B)$ in the following way. If $C$ and
$D$ are not isogenous $\Hom(A,B) = 0$. If $C$ and $D$ are isogenous,
$$
  \Hom(A,B)\tensor\Q = \Hom(C^e, D^f) \tensor \Q = \Mat_{e \times f} (\End(C) \tensor \Q).
$$
%Then we compute
%$$
%   \Hom(A,B) \subset \Hom(A,B) \tensor \Q
%$$ using Algorithm~\ref{}.
\item{} [General case] We compute each $\Hom(C_i^{e_i}, C_j^{f_j})\tensor\Q$ as in Step~\ref{step:simplecase}
and obtain $\Hom(\prod C_i^{e_i}, \prod C_j^{f_j})\tensor\Q$ as a
matrix with blocks $\Hom(C_i^{e_i},C_j^{f_j})\tensor\Q$ for each pair $(i,j)$.
%Then we find $\Hom(A,B)$ inside $\Hom(\prod C_i^{e_i}, \prod C_j^{f_j})\tensor\Q$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
Suppose first that $A \sim C^e$, $B \sim D^f$ with $C,D$ simple abelian varieties.
When $C$ and $D$ are not isogenous there is no morphism $A \to B$, so
$\Hom(A,B) =  0$. When $C$ and $D$ are isogenous, a morphism $C^e \to D^f$
over $\Q$ is given by an $e \times f$ matrix with entries from $\End(A) \tensor
\Q$, where the $(i,j)$th entry represents the morphism between the $i$th
component of $A$ and $j$th component of $B$. We get $\End(A) \tensor \Q$
using Algorithm~\ref{}. Once we have $\Hom(A,B)
\tensor \Q$, to get $\Hom(A,B)$ we only need to apply Proposition~\ref{prop:end}.

In general, when $A = \prod_{i \in I} C_i^{e_i}$ and $B = \prod_{i \in I}
C_i^{f_i}$ we get $\Hom(C_i^{e_i}, C_j^{f_j})$ as before and combining these
blocks we obtain $\Hom(A,B)$.

\subsection{Isogenies and Isomorphisms of Modular Abelian Varieties}

\subsubsection{Isogenies From $A$ to $B$}

\begin{algorithm}{Test if Isogenous}
    Given two modular abelian varieties $A$ and $B$, this
    algorithm decides whether or not $A$ and $B$ are isogenous, and if
    so returns an isogeny between them.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{} [$A$, $B$ both simple] When $A$ and $B$ are both simple they
  are isogenenous to abelian varieties $A_f$ and $A_g$ attached to
  newforms; we can find explicit isogenies using Algorithm~\ref{}.
  Then $A$ is isogenous to $B$ if and only if $A_f = A_g$, i.e., $f$
  and $g$ are Galois conjugate.


\item{} [Pair off factors] When $A$ and $B$ are not simple we pair off
  factors, i.e. for any $C$ in a factorization of $A$ we check if
  there is an isogenous $D$ in a factorization of $B$. If such $D$
  exists and the multiplicities of $C$ in $ A$ and $D$ in $B$ are the
  same we remove $D$ and continue with another $C$. Otherwise, $A$ and
  $B$ cannot be isogenous.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
  When $A$ and $B$ are simple, by \cite[\S5]{faltings:finiteness}
  $A\isog A_f$ and $B\isog A_g$ are isogenous if and only if the
  corresponding newforms $f$ and $g$ are Galois conjugate,
since $f$ and $g$ determine $L(A_f,s)$ ad $L(A_g,s)$.

If $A \sim \prod_{i \in I} A_i^{e_i}$ and $B \sim \prod_{i \in I}
B_i^{e_i}$, indexed so that $A_i \sim B_i$ for all $i \in I$, then we
get that the products $\prod_{i \in I} A_i^{e_i}$ and $\prod_{i \in I}
B_i^{e_i}$ are isogenous, so $A$ and $B$ are also isogenous.

  Conversely, suppose that $A \sim B$ and $\varphi: A \to B$ is some
  isogeny.  Let $A \sim \prod_{i \in I} A_i^{e_i}$ and $B \sim
  \prod_{j \in J} B_j^{f_j}$ be factorizations of $A$ and $B$ into
  products of powers of non-isogenous simple abelian varieties. Fix an
  index $i \in I$.  Combining the maps from $A_i$ to $A$, from $A$ to
  $B$, and the projection to $B_j$ for each $j$ we obtain morphisms
  $\phi_{ij}: A_i \to B_j$ for all $j \in J$. Since the image of an
  abelian variety is an abelian variety and all $B_j$'s are simple it
  follows that $\varphi_{ij}(A_i)$ is either zero or all of $B_j$,
  which means that $A_i$ and $B_j$ are isogenous. It is not possible
  that all $\varphi_{ij}(A_i)$ are zero since that would imply that
  $\varphi$ is the zero map, so we find a $B_j$ isogenous to
  $A_i$. Removing $A_i$ and $B_j$ from the factorizations and
  repeating this argument yields that $A$ and $B$ are isogenous if and
  only if there is a bijection $\sigma:I\to J$ such that $A_i$ is
  isogenous to $B_{\sigma(i)}$ for all $i$, and $e_i = f_{\sigma(i)}$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Isomorphisms from $A$ to $B$}

In this section we describe an algorithm to decide whether two simple
modular abelian varieties are isomorphic, and if so to give an
isomorphism.  We do not yet know an algorithm to decide whether two
nonsimple modular abelian varieties are isomorphic (just need a way
to enumerate elements in lattice of small norm -- might be straightforward
if don't care about speed!).

\begin{algorithm}{Norm Equation}
Given an order $\O$ in a number field $K$ and an element $a\in \Q$,
this algorithm finds all solutions in $\O$ to the norm equation
$\Norm(x)=a$, up to units of $\O$.

Replace the following by a reference to Henri Cohen's book, etc.
[[Claus Fieker suggests the following algorithm (we should expand on that)

\item{} [Solve] Deduce all solutions to the norm equation up to units.

\begin{algorithm}{Test if Isomorphic}\label{alg:isom}
Given simple modular abelian varieties $A$ and $B$,
this algorithm either proves that $A$ and $B$ are not isomorphic,
or returns an isomorphism between them (or all isomorphisms,
up to units).

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}[Equal?] If $A=B$, return ``yes'' and the identity map.
\item{}[Isogenous?]  Determine whether $A$ and $B$ are isogenous using Algorithm~\ref{}.
If $A$ and $B$ are not isogenous then return ``no'', and if

\item{}[Solve norm equation] Find solutions (up to units of $\O$) of the norm equations
$\Norm(x) = \pm \sqrt{d}$ in $\O$. If there are no solutions, return ``no''.

\item{}[Isomorphic?]   If a solution $x$ lies in $H_f$, then return ``yes'' and $x\circ f^{-1}$.
(Note that at this point we could also output $x\circ f^{-1}$ and continue
on to return representatives for all isomorphisms up to units.)

\item{}[Not isomorphic?]   If none of the solutions lies in $H_f$, return ``no''.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
  Let $f:B \to A$ be an isogeny and denote its degree by $d$. Define
  $$H_f = \{f \circ g: g \in \Hom(A,B)\} \subset \End(A).$$
  Since
  degree is multiplicative, $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic if and only if
  the subset $H_f$ of $\End(A)$ contains an element of degree $d$. Embed $\End(A)$ into the
  number field $K =
  \End(A) \otimes \Q$ and let $\O$ be the order in $K$ that is the image of
  $\End(A)$. By \cite[Prop~12.12]{milne:abvars}, for
  $x \in K$ we have $\Norm(x)^2 = \deg(x)$. Thus, finding an element
  of degree $d$ in $H_f$ is equivalent to finding $x \in \O$ with
  $\Norm(x) = \pm \sqrt{d}$, such that $x \in H_f$, where we view
$H_f$ as a subset of~$K$ using the above inclusions.

Using Algorithm~\ref{}, we find all $x$ such that $\Norm(x) = \pm
\sqrt{d}$, up to units of $\O$.  There are may be infinitely many
units, e.g., if $K$ is a real quadratic field, so there are often
infinitely many solutions to the norm equation and we cannot directly
check whether at least one of these infinitely many are in $H_f$.
However, because there are only finitely many solutions up to units,
it will suffice to show that $H_f$ is stable under units and to check
whether each representative solution is in $H_f$.  Thus to finish
the proof of correctness of the algorithm, we verify that $x\in H_f$ if
and only if $xu \in H_f$, where $u$ is any unit of $\O$.  If $x = f
\circ g$ for some $g \in \Hom(A,B)$, then $xu = f \circ (g \circ u)$
is in $H_f$ since $g \circ u \in \Hom(A,B)$.  Conversely, if $xu\in
H_f$, then by what we have just shown $x = xuu^{-1} \in H_f$.
\end{proof}

Discuss how non-simple case works.  Still just need to solve a norm
equation but solving it is more complicated (?).

\subsubsection{The Minimal Isogeny}

A small extension of Algorithm~\ref{} gives us the minimal degree of any
isogeny between two isogenous modular abelian varieties.
[[delete below and just say that we run through all square multiples
of $d$ instead of just $d$ in the algorithm above.  the below
is riddled with errors anyways.]]


\begin{algorithm}{Minimal Isogeny}
Given simple modular abelian varieties $A$ and $B$,
this algorithm checks if $A$ and $B$ are isogenous and if so returns the
minimal degree of an isogeny $A \to B$ together with an isogeny of
that degree.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{} [Equal?]  If $A=B$, return 1 and the identity map.
\item{} [Isogenous?]  Determine whether $A$ and $B$ are isogenous using Algorithm~\ref{}.
       If $A$ and $B$ are not isogenous then return ``not isogenous'', and if
       $A$ and $B$ are isogenous, let $f : B \to A$ be some isogeny.
\item{} [Degree of some isogeny] Compute $\deg(f)$ using Algorithm~\ref{}. Write $\deg(f)$ as $a b^2$, where
          $a$ is squarefree.
\item{} [Endomorphism algebra] Compute the number field $K=\End(A)\tensor\Q$, and
      an embedding of $\End(A)$ into $K$ using Algorithm~\ref{}.
\item{} [Hom space] Compute $\Hom(A,B)$ using Algorithm~\ref{}.
\item{} [Image of Hom space] Compute the image $H_f$ of $\Hom(A,B)$ in $\End(A)$
      got by composing with $f$...
\item{} [Endomorphism ring] Compute the order $\O$ in $K$ generated by $\End(A)$
Algorithm~\ref{}.
\item{} [Initialize] Let $i = 0$.
\item{} [Solve norm equation]\label{step:increasei} Increase $i$ by one and find the solutions (up to units of $\O$) of the norm equations
$\Norm(x) = \pm a b i$ in $\O$. If there are no solutions, repeat this step.
\item{} [Lift to $H_f$?] For each solution (up to units), check whether it lies in $H_f$.
\item{} [Isogenous of degree $ai^2$?] If a solution $x$ lies in $H_f$, then return $a  i^2$ and $x\circ f^{-1}$.
\item{} [Should try isogeny of higher degree] If none of the solutions lies in $H_f$, return
to Step~\ref{step:increasei}.
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}
\begin{proof}
Let $f:A \to B$ be an isogeny and denote its degree by $d = ab^2$, where $a$ is
squarefree. Define $H_f = \{\phi \circ f: \phi \in
\Hom(B,A)\} \subset \End(A)$. Since degree is multiplicative, $B$ and $A$ are
isogenous via an isogeny of degree $d'$ if and only if $H_f$ contains an element
of degree $d d'$. Embed
$\End(A)$ into $K = \End(A) \otimes \Q$ and let $\O$ be the order in $K$
generated by $\End(A)$. By Proposition 12.12. in Milne's "Abelian Varieties"
for $x \in K$ we have $\Norm^2(x) = \deg(x)$. Thus, finding an element of
degree $dd'$ in $H_f$ is equivalent to finding $x \in \O$ with $\Norm(x) =
\pm \sqrt{dd'}$, such that $x$ actually comes from $H_f$. Hence, the possible
values for $d'$ are $a i^2$ for $i \in \N$. We can find all $x$
such that $\Norm(x) = \pm \sqrt{dd'}$ up to units of $\O$.
The proof that this suffices is the same as the end of the
proof of Algorithm~\ref{alg:isom}.
\end{proof}

\section{Computing the Isogeny Class}

Discuss problem of finding lots of non-isomorphic $A$ in the isogeny
class of $A_f$.

Various ways to compute finite $\Gal(\Qbar/\Q)$-stable subgroups of
$A$.  (I.e., kernel of maps to higher level $Np$.  Intersection with
other $A_g$'s.  Intersection with (or image of) cuspidal subgroup,
Shimura subgroup, cut out using Hecke operators when the dimension is
bigger than $1$, etc.)

\begin{example}
We show that the $\Q$-isogeny class of {\bf 43B} contains at least three
non-isomorphic abelian varieties.

\subsection{The Class Group -- Noneisenstein Isogenies}
\label{sec:clgp}
Here we make this more precise. Suppose that $N$ is prime. Let $A$ be
a simple modular abelian variety and let $f$ be the associated
normalized newform. Denote by $\O$ the finite $\Z$-algebra generated
by the coefficients of $f$ and consider $H = \Cl(\O)$.  Let $S =
\{\mathfrak{q}_i \}$ be a set of representatives for $H$ such that
$\mathfrak{q}_i$ has odd residual characteristic and is
non-Eisenstein. Then the following proposition describes all possible
simple abelian varieties that are isogenous to $A$ with an isogeny
whose kernel has support outside the Eisenstein primes and primes of
residual characteristic 2.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:noneis}
Let $\varphi : A \to A'$ be an isogeny whose kernel has support outside the
Eisenstein primes and primes of residual characteristic 2. Then $A' \simeq
A/A[\mathfrak{q}]$ for some $\mathfrak{q} \in H$.
\end{proposition}

This method gives us at least part of the isogeny class.  [[Note that at the
end of his notes Frank mentions a relation between the Eisenstein
primes and non-trivial isogenies.]]


\subsection{Eisenstein Isogenies}
Quotient out by any subgroup of the cuspidal subgroup.

Quotient out by any subgroup of the Shimura subgroup $\Sigma$.
The Shimura subgroup is by definition the kernel of the natural
map $J_0(N)\to J_1(N)$ induced by $X_1(N)\to X_0(N)$.
Paper Ling and Oesterl\'e that describes $\Sigma$
in computable terms directly at level $N$.

Suppose $A, B\subset J_0(M)$ are simple and non-isogenous,
for some $M$. Then $A/(A\cap{}B)$ is isogenous to $A$.

Remark: Kernels of endomorphisms have square degree.
So quotienting out by any rational subgroup of
nonsquare order gives a nontrivial isogeny.  Get these from $C$.

\subsection{Enumerating the Isogeny Class}

Do all the  operations above suffice to enumerate all
elements of {\em any} isogeny class?   If not, what do we miss.


\section{Tables of Modular Abelian Varieties}
\subsection{Contents}


For each $N\leq 125$ (say), compute all modabvars for $J_0(N)$.
Also for each $N\leq 49$ (say), compute all modabvars for $J_H(N)$ for
all $H$.  Also do $J_0(389)$, say.
For each compute:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Field $F = \End(A)\tensor \Q)$; $disc(F)$; description of $O=\End(A) \subset F$ and of $\T'\subset \End(A)$.
\item first few coefficients of $q$-expansion
\item all non-isomorphic elements of the isogeny class (found using our methods),
which we label
\item a graph showing the isogenies with their structure (degree, etc.)
\item the matrix showing structure of intersections between all simple new
abvars of level $N$
\item index of $\T$ in $\End(A_f)$
\item discriminant of $\End(A_f)$
\item modular degree; modular kernel with Hecke action (?)
\item cuspidal subgroup
\item rational cuspidal subgroup
\item torsion subgroup (if possible)
\item real volume to some precision
\item component group orders (or bounds) -- this will require
implementing quaternion algebra ideal arithmetic.
\item tamagawa numbers
\item analytic rank
\item rational part of special value
\item first 10 zeros in the critical strip
\item leading coefficient of $p$-adic $L$-series
for first $10$ good primes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Factors of $J_H(N)$ for $N\leq 49$}

\subsection{Minimal Isogenies}
%For every factor $A_f$ of $J_0(N)$ for $N<1000$ and such that the
%computation takes at most $n$ minutes, we used the first author's
%MAGMA package ... to compute the minimal degree of an isogeny from
%$A_f^{\vee}$ to $A_f$ (and structure of kernel).

Connections with computing curves $X$ whose Jacobian is an $A_f$.

[[Papers of people about this, and they care about whether $A_f$
is isomorphic to its dual.  Frey students...]]

\subsection{Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer}
Connections with BSD.  Away from $2$ and minimal degree of isogeny,
the order of $\Sha$ (mod maximal divisible subgroup) is a perfect
square (reference [[william will find]]).  Our data is consistent
with [[william will find]].


\subsection{Other Examples}
$J_0(389)$.

[[move this into the paper itself]]

\subsection{Level $35$}
It's not obvious that $A_f$ is iso. to its dual.
\begin{verbatim}
[35, 2, 2, 1, 6, x^4 + 2*x^3 - 7*x^2 - 8*x + 16],
\end{verbatim}

Mention 6-author paper and Hasegawa, but that kernel of modular
polarization is NOT kernel of multiplication by an integer,
so Wang excludes.

Kernel is $(\Z/2\Z)^2$, which is not $\ker([2])=(\Z/2\Z)^4$.

\begin{verbatim}
> J := JZero(35);
> A := J(2);
> Dual(A);
Modular abelian variety of dimension 2 and level 5*7 over Q
> Kernel(ModularPolarization(A));
Finitely generated subgroup of abelian variety with
invariants [ 2, 2 ]
\end{verbatim}

There is a solution, and it gives an iso.

\subsection{Level $69$: The first $A_f$ that is not
isomorphic to $A_f^{\vee}$}


Let $A$ be the second factor in the decomposition of $J_0(69)$.
[[Say $\dim(A) = 2$, etc., which determines $A$.]]
 Then $A$ is
not isomorphic to its dual $A^\vee$ because there are no solutions to the norm
equation [...].
A minimal isogeny between $A$ and $A^\vee$ is of degree 4 and is given on the integral
homology by
\[ \left( \begin{matrix}
\hfill 1 & \hfill 0 & \hfill 2 & -2 \\
\hfill 0 & \hfill 1 & \hfill 0 & \hfill 0 \\
-2 & \hfill 1 &\hfill  0 &\hfill  2 \\
\hfill 4 & -2 & \hspace{1.2ex} 2 & -4 \end{matrix} \right)\]
[[That's meaningless without a basis!]]


\subsection{Level $195$: An $A_f$ not isomorphic to
its dual, though there are solutions to the norm equation}

$[195, 5, 3, [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 176, 176 ], 0, 6, x^6 - 14*x^4 - 4*x^3 + 49*x^2 +
28*x + 4] $

There are solutions to the norm equation, but none of them works.

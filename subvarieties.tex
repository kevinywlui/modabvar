\section{Enumerating Abelian Subvarieties of $J_0(N)$}

The goal of this section is to enumerate the simple isomorphism classes of
subvarieties of $J_0(N)$. There is a decomposition of $J_0(N)$ as 
\[
    J_0(N) \approx 
    \sum_{f} V_f,
\]
where $V_f=A_f ^{m_f}$, where the sum runs through newforms $f$ of level $L$
and $m_f$ is the number of divisors of $N/L$. Every abelian subvariety is the
image of an endomorphism of $J_0(N)$ and $\Hom(V_f, V_g)$ is trivial for
distinct $f$ and $g$. So the goal of this section can be restated as
enumerating the isomorphism classes of subvarieties of $V_f$ for all $f$.
Because of multiplicity one, we have that $V_f$ is already simple when $f$ is
of level $N$. Hence, the problem reduces to enumerating the subvarieties of
$V_f$ when $f$ is an oldform.

The main idea is that every simple abelian varieties is the image of an
integral linear combination of degeneracy maps. The kernel of such a map is
then related to the Shimura subgroup by the work of Ribet and Ling. The Galois
structure of the Shimura subgroup has been studied by Ling-Oesterle so we
should be able to enumerate the $\Gal(\QQbar/\QQ)$-submodules of the Shimura
subgroup maybe hopefully.

\begin{proposition}
    Let $A$ be a simple subvariety of $J_1(N)$. From the work of Shimura,
    there exists a divisor $L$ of $N$ and a newform $f$ of level $L$ such that
    $A_f \sim A$. Let $d_1,\ldots,d_r$ be the full collection of degeneracy
    maps from $J_0(L)$ to $J_0(N)$. Then there exists integers $n_1,\ldots,n_r$
    such that $S:=\sum n_i d_i: A_f\to A$ is an isogeny from $A_f$ to $A$. Note
    that $S$ is defined over $\QQ$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $V_f=\sum_{i=1} ^r d_i(A_f)$ and $\Phi:A_f ^r \to V_f$ be defined by
    $\Phi(x_1,\ldots,x_r) = d_1(x_1)+\cdots+d_r(x_r)$. Let $K_f$ be the Fourier
    coefficent field of $f$. Since $A$ is an abelian subvariety of $V_f$, there
    exists $M\in \End_0(V)\cong M_{r\times r} (\End_0(A_f)) = M_{r\times r}
    (K_f)$ such that $\Im M = A$. Let $i:A_f\to A_f ^r$ be the inclusion map
    into the first coordinate. Then there exists $U\in \Aut(A_f
    ^r)=\GL_r (K_f)$ such that,
    \[
        \begin{tikzcd}
            A_f \arrow[r,"i"] &
            A_f ^l \arrow[r, dotted, "U"] &
            A_f ^l \arrow[r, "\Phi"] &
            V_f \arrow[r, "M"] &
            A,
        \end{tikzcd}
    \]
    the map $T:=M \circ \Phi \circ U\circ i:A_f\to A$ is an isogeny. Since
    degeneracy maps are $K_f$-linear, there exists coefficents
    $a_1,\ldots,a_r\in K_f$ such that $T = \sum a_i d_i$. Moreover,
    $T(\Lambda_{A_f})=\Lambda_A$, so $a_i\in \QQ$. Abelian varieties are
    divisible so we can clear denominators and assume $a_i\in \ZZ$, as desired.
\end{proof}

The goal now is to understand the relationship between different degeneracy
maps. Let
\[
    \Phi_L = \prod_{i=1} ^r d_i ^* : J_0(L)^r \to J_0(N)
\]
and
\[
    \Sigma(L)_0 ^r =\{(x_1,\ldots,x_r)\in \Sigma(L)^r: \sum x_i = 0\}.
\]
We say $(L, N)$ satisifies the $\star$-condition if $\Ker\Phi_L=\Sigma(L)_0$.

\begin{theorem}
    Let $L$ and $M$ be relatively prime integers with $M$ squarefree. Let
    \[
        \Phi_L = \prod_{i=1} ^r d_{L,t_i} ^* : J_0(L)^r \to J_0(LM)
    \]
    be as defined above. Then
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            If $L$ is odd or $M$ is prime, then $\Sigma(L)_0 ^r=\ker\Phi_L$.
        \item
            If $L$ is even and $M$ is not a prime, then $\Sigma(L)_0 ^r
            \subseteq \ker\Phi_L$ and $[\ker\Phi_L: \Sigma(L)_0 ^r]$ is
            a power of 2.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
    Suppose $(L, N)$ satisifies the $\star$-condition, then $\Ker S\subseteq
    \Sigma(L)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{question}
    Let $A$ be a simple subvariety of $J_0(N)$ for some $N$. Let $\mathcal{I}$
    be the isogeny class of $A$. For all $B\in \mathcal{I}$, is $B$ a
    subvariety of $J_0(M)$ for some $M$?
\end{question}
The answer is no. Here's an example.

\begin{question}
    Let $M$ be a $\Gal(\QQbar/\QQ)$-submodule of $J_0(L)$. Does there exists
    $N$ and an integral linear combination of degeneracy maps $S:=\sum n_i d_i$
    such that $\Ker S=M$? This is the converse to the earlier corollary.
\end{question}
